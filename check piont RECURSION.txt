The processing for determining if a word is a palindrome can be broken down as follows:

1. Start with the input word.
2. Compare the characters located at the ends of the word (i.e., the first and last characters).
3. If these characters are equal, proceed to test the rest of the word.
4. If the characters at the ends are different, stop and conclude that the word is not a palindrome.
5. Continue this process by moving inwards, comparing the next characters from the ends.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until you either find a pair of different characters, in which case you stop and conclude that the word is not a palindrome, 
or until you have compared all characters and found them to be equal.
7. The stop condition for determining a palindrome is:
   - An empty word (no characters) is considered a palindrome.
   - A word containing a single character is also considered a palindrome.

In summary, you compare characters at the ends of the word, moving inwards while checking for 
equality. If you find any pair of characters that are different,
 you can immediately conclude that the word is not a palindrome. 
Otherwise, if you successfully compare all characters without finding any differences and reach the stop conditions, then the word is a palindrome.
